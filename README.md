This project aims to develop a wireless sensor-based autonomous mobile robot that can monitor and analyze vital farm parameters like humidity, environmental temperature, and moisture content of the soil in real-time. Additionally, the robot is equipped with image processing techniques to detect plant diseases on leaves and a spraying mechanism for chemical, fertilizer, and water applications to promote healthy plant growth.

Introduction

This project presents an innovative approach to farm management using wireless sensor technology and image processing. By using an autonomous mobile robot, we can remotely monitor and analyze vital farm parameters, thus providing real-time data that farmers can use to make informed decisions. The robot also features an automatic plant disease detection mechanism that uses image processing techniques to identify diseases on plant leaves. The robot's spraying mechanism can automatically apply chemicals, fertilizer, and water to the plant as needed to promote healthy growth.
Features

The key features of the wireless sensor-based autonomous mobile robot are as follows:

    Wireless sensors for remote real-time monitoring of humidity, environmental temperature, and moisture content of the soil

ANALYSIS OF FINAL DESIGN

Automatic agricultural spraying robots could help small-scale farmers in Ghana carry out a host of field and yard tasks, including mowing, pellet spreading and spraying.
The fully electric R150-ATJ platform has a four-wheel-drive system and a turning diameter of just 0.7m, thanks to its skid-steer-style movement.
The 48v lithium batteries offer a 30min runtime with two batteries to keep the robot running continuously, with just a 15min recharge time from empty and the ability to run in the dark, 24 hours a day.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE TASKS
In conclusion, designing and developing autonomous chemical spraying for a fertigation farm has been successfully conducted. All the subsystems such as navigation systems and spraying systems are included. Although the navigation part has been tested, the autonomous chemical sprayer robot can be self-navigating by turning at the junction by using the obstacles detection concept inside the fertigation farm. The ultrasonic sensors were used in the front of the sensor it was adjacently facing forward at 90° while the other two left and right were both facing forward with a deflection of 45°. The ultrasonic sensor could detect the obstacles and stop without hitting the obstacles, respectively. For future works, the spraying pressure of the autonomous chemical sprayer robot will be tested and the electronic circuits need a waterproof structure since the autonomous pastiche ide sprayer robot deals with a chemical which is fluid. Therefore, the isolation of the electronic component should be done well by separating each electronic component in the container box to prevent it from being damaged if flooding or leakage happened inside the robot. On the other hand, the pest monitoring system should be developed to be an auto-monitoring device while spraying the chemical. Thus, using the advanced version of automatic agro sprayers for agriculture would make the heavier tasks much easier. A world might be expected shortly that replaces the futile sprayers with the proficient automated Argo-sprayer.


Usage

To use the wireless sensor-based autonomous mobile robot, follow these steps:

    Place the robot on the farmland and turn it on.
    The robot will automatically start surveying the farmland, collecting data on humidity, temperature, and soil moisture content.
    The robot will also use its image processing capabilities to detect diseases on plant leaves.
    If a disease is detected, the robot will automatically apply the necessary chemicals, fertilizer, or water to the plant.
    The robot will continue to survey the farmland and provide real-time data to the farmer.
