This repo contains the resources for my final project involving an automatic agricultural spraying robot for Intro to Engineering college course. 


# Automatic Agricultural Spraying Robot with Smart Decision Making

This project aims to develop a wireless sensor-based autonomous mobile robot that can monitor and analyze vital farm parameters like humidity, environmental temperature, and moisture content of the soil in real-time. Additionally, the robot is equipped with image processing techniques to detect plant diseases on leaves and a spraying mechanism for chemical, fertilizer, and water applications to promote healthy plant growth.

Introduction

This project presents an innovative approach to farm management using wireless sensor technology and image processing. By using an autonomous mobile robot, we can remotely monitor and analyze vital farm parameters, thus providing real-time data that farmers can use to make informed decisions. The robot also features an automatic plant disease detection mechanism that uses image processing techniques to identify diseases on plant leaves. The robot's spraying mechanism can automatically apply chemicals, fertilizer, and water to the plant as needed to promote healthy growth.
Features

The key features of the wireless sensor-based autonomous mobile robot are as follows:

    Wireless sensors for remote real-time monitoring of humidity, environmental temperature, and moisture content of the soil
    Vision-based automatic disease detection on plant leaves using image processing techniques
    Spraying mechanism for applying chemicals, fertilizer, and water to the plant as needed for healthy growth
    Compact, portable, and well-founded platform
    Autonomous navigation and surveying of farmland
    Real-time data analysis and reporting

Technologies

The following technologies are used in this project:

    Arduino
    Raspberry Pi
    Wireless sensors
    Image processing software
    GPS module
    Motor drivers
    Battery
    Chassis
    Wheels

Installation

To use the wireless sensor-based autonomous mobile robot, follow these steps:

    Clone the project from the GitHub repository to your local machine.
    Install the necessary software and hardware components as described in the project documentation.
    Configure the wireless sensors and image processing software according to your requirements.
    Connect the battery, motor drivers, and GPS module to the robot.
    Turn on the robot and start monitoring and analyzing the farm parameters.

Usage

To use the wireless sensor-based autonomous mobile robot, follow these steps:

    Place the robot on the farmland and turn it on.
    The robot will automatically start surveying the farmland, collecting data on humidity, temperature, and soil moisture content.
    The robot will also use its image processing capabilities to detect diseases on plant leaves.
    If a disease is detected, the robot will automatically apply the necessary chemicals, fertilizer, or water to the plant.
    The robot will continue to survey the farmland and provide real-time data to the farmer.
